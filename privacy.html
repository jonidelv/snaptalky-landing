  <h1>Privacy Policy Snaptalky</h1>
  <h2 class="title">1. Introduction</h2>
  <p class="content">
    Welcome to Snaptalky. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.
  </p>

  <h2 class="title">2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p class="content">
    We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the app includes:
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    <strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect personal information such as your name, address, or email directly. However, if you provide proof of age or a bio, we store that in our database.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    <strong>Derivative Data:</strong> Information our servers automatically collect when you access the app, such as your device ID and usage information. We do not store IP addresses.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    <strong>Images:</strong> The app uses images (screenshots or profiles) provided by you to generate AI responses. These images are sent to the server for processing and are not saved or stored by us.
  </p>

  <h2 class="title">3. Use of Your Information</h2>
  <p class="content">
    Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the app to:
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    <strong>1. Generate AI responses:</strong> Use your text, screenshots, or profiles to generate AI responses tailored to your conversation needs.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    <strong>2. Improve Service:</strong> Save some of the AI-generated responses chosen by you to enhance the app's learning and improve future suggestions.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    <strong>3. Monitor Usage:</strong> Analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the app.
  </p>

  <h2 class="title">4. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
  <p class="content">
    We do not sell any data collected from users. All data is kept private.
  </p>

  <h2 class="title">5. Security of Your Information</h2>
  <p class="content">
    We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.
  </p>

  <h2 class="title">6. Policy for Children</h2>
  <p class="content">
    We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If we learn we have collected information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
  </p>

  <h2 class="title">7. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
  <p class="content">
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2 class="title">8. Options Regarding Your Information</h2>
  <p class="content">
    <strong>Account Information:</strong> You may at any time review or change the information in your account or terminate your account by:
  </p>
  <ul class="content">
    <li>1. Logging into your account settings and updating your account.</li>
    <li>2. Contacting us using the contact information provided below.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="content">
    Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.
  </p>
